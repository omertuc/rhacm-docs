We (the documentation squad) are part of the ACM team and are responsible for documenting Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. We also work on a variety of other tasks, such as reviewing and editing technical blogs, reviewing UI content with designers, and resolving bugs and issues by using agile scrum techniques. We use the `Documentation` component as an identifier on platforms like Jira and work closely with developers to maintain the documentation.

**Important:** Please see the ACM Playbook for details about how to work as part of the ACM team. The ACM Playbook also includes the link to a general onboarding guide. This website primarily serves as internal documentation for us. It outlines our work processes and standards. That being said, other ACM team members might find the resources and information listed on this website useful as well.

## Setting up
See what hardware, software, and tools you need to get started.

### Hardware

Ask your manager or team members about the hardware we use. You can also ask about hardware options for your assigned desk, if you have one. When choosing a computer, remember that we can only help you with systems we are familiar with. You can also consult with IT, keeping in mind that they can only help you with approved hardware that they provide.

The primary messaging software we use. This is also how we discuss things virtually with development, QE, and support. You will want to join the teams for your component areas.
